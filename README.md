# Shortest path algorithm
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures that developers use to perform calculations and solve computational problems.
In this project, I will use functions, loops, conditional statements, and dictionary comprehensions to implement a Shortest Path algorithm.

## Overview

The script includes:
1. **Dictionary Manipulation**: A dictionary representing a guinea pig, modifying and deleting keys, and iterating over key-value pairs.
2. **Graph Representation**: A dictionary representing a weighted graph.
3. **Shortest Path Calculation**: A function to initialize distances and paths for computing the shortest path.

### Shortest Path Initialization

This function initializes the shortest path calculation by:
- Setting all distances to infinity except the starting node (0 distance)
- Initializing paths
- Printing the initial state
